## 1D Ising Model with Transverse Field
The Hamiltonian of the system is:

$$H = - \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sigma^z_n \sigma^z_{n+1} - \sum_{n=1}^{N} g_n\sigma^x_n$$

where:
- $N$ is the number of spin-1/2 particles.
- $g$ is the transverse magnetic field strength.
- $\sigma^x_n$, $\sigma^z_n$ are spin-1/2 operators at site $n$ in $\hat{x}, \hat{z}$ direction.

One-dimensional Ising model with transverse magnetic field is described by the hamoltonian:
$$
\begin{align}
H = - \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{i+1} - g \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sigma^x_i
\end{align}
$$
Where $N$ is a number of spin-1/2 particles, $g$ is a magnetic field in $\hat{x}$ direction, and $\sigma^x_i$, $\sigma^z_i$ are spin-1/2 operators associated with a site $i$ in $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{z}$ direction respectively.
